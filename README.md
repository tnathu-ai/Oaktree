# Oaktree Inerview
Interview - Data Analyst @ Oaktree


## Use the right tool for the job 

When choosing an ingestion method for your data analytics solution, you need to consider:

+ The frequency of your data
+ The volume of the data (633KB)
+ The source the data is coming from. 

This subdomain focuses on two main questions that will help determine which tool would best match your requirements:
+ How quickly do you need the analytics results?  In real time, in seconds, or is an hour a more appropriate time frame?
+ Where is the data coming from?
